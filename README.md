# ShopWeb
made in C# Believe it or not.
Should **never** ever be actually used, it's just an example of how one can use C# to build a website.

## MVC
This stuff uses the MVC (model, viewer, controllers) setup. Feel free to remake it into an API and use Javascript etc. It's kinda cool actually, I promise.
